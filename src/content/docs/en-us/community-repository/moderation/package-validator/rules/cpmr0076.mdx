## Issue

In the nuspec, the Icon URL has been specified as coming from GitHub or RawGit.

## Recommended Solution

Please update the Icon URL to use an Icon that is coming from a proper CDN instead of GitHub or RawGit.
There are CDN providers for GitHub links that can be used, like [JSDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) and [Statically](https://statically.io/).

## Reasoning

GitHub has made it clear that hotlinking to _raw_ files on GitHub should be avoided, as these are not static assets, and RawGit has shut down.
See the [GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/2013-04-24-heads-up-nosniff-header-support-coming-to-chrome-and-firefox/) for more information.
